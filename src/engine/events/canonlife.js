// The canon timeline runs out. After that - and in the long gaps between the

// they stood where the data file put them and nothing happened to them for
// sixty years. This pack gives them their own decade. They take students, hit
// walls, break through, marry, retire, bury each other, and turn up at your
// door because they heard about you.
//
// Nothing here is a written scene. A template picks a living canon character
// whose tags fit the beat, and the beat renders against them.
