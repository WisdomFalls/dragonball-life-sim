// The dragon, and what you ask it for.
//
// A wish used to be one of a dozen buttons. It is the largest single decision
// in this setting - people spend whole sagas gathering the balls - so it now
// runs as a conversation: the dragon comes up, you pick a category, you pick a
// wish, and for some of them you pick who or what it lands on. Porunga grants
// three and stays in the sky between them. You can also just say what you want
// out loud, and a dragon is a literal creature about that.
